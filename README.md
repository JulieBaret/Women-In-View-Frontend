<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## âœ¨ About the project
*"I only go to a movie if it satisfies three basic requirements. One, it has to have at least two women in it who, two, talk to each other about, three, something besides a man."*
<p>Here are the basis of the Bechdel test. The "Women in view" project aims to shed light on the Bechdel Test and its impact on pop culture by scrutinizing the portrayal of female characters in works of fiction.</p>
<p>Through this web application, users will have the opportunity to delve deeper into the Bechdel test, search for films, and determine whether they pass or not the Bechdel test. Moreover, users can actively contribute to the database by testing films themselves against the Bechdel test's standards, thus fostering a more comprehensive understanding of gender representation in media.</p>
